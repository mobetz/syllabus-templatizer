<h3>Painting Lab</h3>

<p>This week, we are going to be writing a program that can visually depict a grid of colored symbols described in a file.
To assist with this painting program, I have provided for you an already written class: PaintingCell. A PaintingCell's job is to represent one symbol in the grid. A constructed PaintingCell has several functions that can help you solve this problem, such as the ability to .changeColor() and the ability to convert itself toString() to display a star based on its color. You can get a full explanation of how PaintingCell works by compiling the javadoc page for PaintingCell.java. I've also provided a few test ".pnt" files you'll be able to use with your code.
In addition to the prebuilt PaintingCell class, you are going to create two more classes:</p>

<h4>Painting</h4>
<p>A painting tracks the following data:</p>
<ul>
    <li>a height</li>
    <li>a width</li>
    <li>a 'grid' of PaintingCells (a 'grid' is a 2D array -- an array where the type of variable in each 'slot' of the array is a sub-array.)</li>
</ul>

<p>When a painting <b>is constructed</b>...</p>
<ul>
    <li> The painting is given its height and width as integers.</li>
    <li>These integers are stored on attributes, then used to construct a grid that can hold [height] x [width] painting cells.</li>
    <li>For each row number in this constructed grid:</li>
    <li>For each column in that row:</li>
    <ul><li>Save a newly created painting cell into that row and column of your grid.</li></ul>



When a painting wants to check boundaries of a given row and column...
* The painting receives the row and column the user wants to check.
* If the row is between 0 and the painting's height and the column is between 0 and the painting's width, then the result of the check is true.
* In any other case, the result of the check is false.

When a painting wants to paint a cell...
* The painting receives the row, the column, and the color of the target cell.
* If the row and column provided are inside the checked boundaries, then:
- The painting retrieves the cell at that row and column from its grid, and changes the color of that cell appropriately, and then sets its visibility to true.
* When the cell is successfully edited, painting a cell returns 'true'. Otherwise, it returns false.

When a painting wants to erase a cell...
* The painting receives the row, the column, and the color of the target cell.
* If the row and column provided are inside the checked boundaries, then:
- The painting retrieves the cell at that row and column from its grid, and sets the visibility of that cell appropriately.
* When the cell is successfully edited, painting a cell returns 'true'. Otherwise, it returns false.
When a painting wants to convert itself to a String...
* The painting creates a space to hold a string representation.
* For each row of its grid:
* For each column in that row:
- The painting converts the cell in that column and row of the grid into a string, and appends that to the representation.
* NOTE: at the end of each row, you must append a newline character to the representation!
* Once all rows and columns have been processed, the final painting is returned.


I recommend testing your Painting once you make it before you start working on PaintingLoader. You can make a short main method that
just constructs a Painting, sets a few values, then immediately prints it out to ensure that these methods work as you expect, and help you
feel confident in how Painting works before you try to use it for real.


You will also make a Painting loader:
A PaintingLoader does not need to track any data, and can be constructed with a zero argument parameter that does nothing.

PaintingLoader will have one private static helper function: the ability to convert a letter to color:
* Converting a letter to a color starts with a given letter.
* The colors available to a painting are red - "R", yellow - "Y", green -"G" , cyan - "C", blue - "B", purple - "P", black - "X", and white - "O".
* If the painting method receives one of these letters, then it returns the corresponding color.

PaintingLoader will have a public static method: the ability to generate a painting from a File...

* When this method is called, it will be provided with one parameter: a string filepath.
* This filepath will be used to construct and store a File object representing the file holding that information.
* If the File created exists and its path ends with ".pnt":
* PaintingLoader will create a space to track a number of rows, a number of columns, and a group of Strings representing each row of the painting.
- NOTE: you can assume a painting will never have more than 25 rows, and that every column has the same number of symbols.
* PaintingLoader will then make a Scanner that can read the file.
* As long as the scanner still has a next line:
* That next line will be appended to the group of painting rows.
* The number of columns will be set to the length of that line.
* The number of rows will be incremented by one.
* Once the file has finished being read, the loader will construct a new painting object with the appropriate height and width.
* Afterward, for each row number in the painting:
* The loader will retrieve the string representing that row of the painting, and split that row into a group of letters (using .split("") with an empty string splits on every letter.)
* For each column in that group of letters:
* The loader will convert the letter in that cell into a color.
* Afterward, the loader will tell its painting to paint the cell in that row and column the appropriate color.
* Once the entire painting has been painting, the loader will return the finished painting.
* If an invalid path was provided, the method will return null.

After you have created your Painting and Loader, you will create a Main class with a single main method:
* As long as the user has not provided a valid path to a painting:
* Main will ask the user for the path to a painting file.
* It will then use PaintingLoader's ability to generate a painting from that file, and store the resulting painting (or null if the path was invalid).
* Once a valid painting has been loaded, main will convert that painting to a string and print it out.


NOTE: In order to see this lab working on Windows, you will need to make sure you're using the Windows Terminal (you can download it at https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-us&gl=us&rtc=1 .) Once you download it, you can click the little arrow next to the "+" button, and select "Command Prompt" from the list of shells available.
