Objectives for Today

By the end of today, you will:
    * Review the syntax for interacting with arrays and lists in Java.
    * Understand how array indices offset memory.
    * Identify the concept of a pointer.
    * Understand ramifications of passing reference types like collections between classes.
    
Vocabulary for the Day

Pointer - A pointer is a numeric address that "points" to a particular position in
a computer's memory. Pointers are typically used to more efficiently store a 'reference'
to some larger structure of data like an object so that it can be quickly passed between
functions.

        Today we will be concluding our review of the fundamental building blocks of
        Java. Specifically, we will be looking at collection types.
        
        From Programming I, you likely remember that you can declare an array of
        any type by putting square brackets after the type name:
