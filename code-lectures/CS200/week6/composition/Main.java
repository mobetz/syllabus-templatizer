/*
Objectives for Today

By the end of today, you will:
    * Identify the concept of composition.
    * Understand how composition allows us to more expressively model pluggable behaviors for our objects.
    * Practice combining composition and inheritance.

        Last class, we were working on an example that would allow us to give our Students a job. We had seen that
        modeling this just with inheritance is impossible.

        Let's start by recreating some of those objects!


        We had floated the idea of inserting one of these objects into the other rather than inheriting all these
        attributes directly through a supertype. This is a technique called composition -- with composition,
        rather than saying a Student *is* a Worker, we instead say a Student *has* a Job.

        Let's go ahead and see how that would play out in this class.
