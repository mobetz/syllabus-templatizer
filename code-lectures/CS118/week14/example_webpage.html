    A web page uses a special language called HTML. HTML is made up of many "tags" interspersed with text; each tag has
    a starting point and an ending point. For example, this "section" tag says that this section of the web page starts
    on line 10, and continues until we see a matching section tag with a / slash in front of it.
</section>


<section>
    When we start a new section, the web page will automatically add some extra space for us.  Some tags, like the
    <strong>strong tag</strong> or the <em>emphasis tag</em> also cause other changes to the styling or position of text.

    We are not going to dive too deeply into how to create HTML documents in this class (the CS176 section I teach next
    semester is a whole semester about just that!) However, for today, we are going to learn about how we can manipulate these tags using Javascript.

<section id="identifiers">
    Every one of our tags in HTML can have a special identifier assigned to it, almost the same way we would assign
    a variable a name. To do this, we just put id="some-unique-name" after the name of the tag, inside the angle brackets.

    We call these sub-assignments 'attributes', and there are actually many attributes that can change the behavior
    of our tags. However, more importantly, they also give us a way to talk about our tags in Javascript.

<section>
    Before we can do that, we have to do one more quick thing -- at the very front of our web page, we need to add
    one last tag -- a "script" tag. The script tag provides the name of a javascript file that we want to run as soon
    as this web page starts loading. Let's point it at the example-script.js that we started writing at the beginning
    of class, and watch what happens.
