        It would take us a very long time to make one of those on our own. Fortunately, we don't have
        to -- there's a FileChooser class that does it for us! Using this class is as easy as making
        an object, then calling:

            chooser_variable.showOpenDialog(on_some_stage_variable);
       

         This means we'll need to get a reference to our stage. Fortunately, we can get one from any
         control by getting the control's scene, then getting the window from the scene. (Remember, the
         stage is just a metaphor for the window.)
