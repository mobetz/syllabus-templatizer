/*
The build.gradle file is a "project manifest" and general configuration file that describes a lot of details about
the code we've written.


This file uses its own syntax, but in general, we write 'blocks' of configuration by giving them a name, and then
a pair of curly braces; assignments to attributes of objects that already exist; and calls to functions that already
exist.


Inside each block, we write properties we want to configure and give them string values.
 */


/*
The first block in every build.gradle file is the list of plugins. This sets what features the rest of our configuration
file will have. At minimum, we should always include id 'java' for java projects.

We'll also add id 'application' so we can write instructions for running our code:
 */

plugins {
    id 'java'
    id 'application'
}


/*
In addition, we can provide a list of repositories that we want Gradle to be able to search to find our code.

mavenCentral() will give us access to the Maven Central repo:
 */


repositories.mavenCentral();

/* Then, we list off each third party library we want it to download: */
dependencies.implementation("org.apache.commons:commons-csv:1.10.0");


/* Finally, we have to give Gradle some details about where our code lives, and which file contains the main entrypoint:  */

sourceSets.main.java.srcDirs(".");
sourceSets.main.resources.srcDirs("resources")

application.mainClass = "ThirdParty"
