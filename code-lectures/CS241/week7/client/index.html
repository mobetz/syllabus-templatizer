    <h3>Objectives for Today</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Define dynamic content and understand how we can use JavaScript to modify our HTML pages.</li>
        <li>Identify JavaScript variables available in the browser, including the document API and the fetch function.</li>
        <li>Practice creating, accessing, and modifying HTML elements from JavaScript.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Vocabulary</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Document Object Model</strong> - The "Document Object Model" (or DOM) is a representation
            of the content present on an HTML page. This model represents each element of the page as a node on a "tree"
            (much like a folder tree in your file explorer.)</li>


        <li><strong>Promise</strong> - A Promise is a special kind of object that captures asynchronous behavior. A promise
            object has a .then() method that accepts a callback that should run once the asynchronous behavior is complete.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When we make a website, we might start with some static content. However, later on in the page, we might
        want to create content that responds to an API request or user input. We call this type of content "dynamic
        content". </p>


    <p>In order to create dynamic content, we need to use JavaScript. To use JavaScript in the browser, we add
        a <span class="mono">script</span> tag (typically to the head of the document.) This script tag has an src attribute,
        just like images and videos. Lets add a script tag that points to a "main.js" file in the "js" folder of this
        site.</p>


    <p id="dynamic"></p>

    <p>Sometimes, we don't just want to do things immediately when a page loads. Instead, we want to respond to
        an action a user performs. To do this, we can attach an event to the element where the action occurs. For example,
        every <span class="mono">button</span> in a web page has an "onclick" event. We can access that event in two ways:

    <ul>
        <li>We can add a function call to the <span class="mono">onclick</span> attribute of the button.</li>
        <li>We can call addEventListener() with the "click" event on the button object in our JavaScript.</li>
    </ul>


    <div id="form">

        <label>Enter a city:</label>
        <input id="city_field" >
        <label>Salary Minimum:</label>
        <input id="salary_min" type="number" min="0" max="250000" step="1000">
        <button id="search-button" >Search</button>
    </div>

    <p>Let's also create a shell of a table to hold our search results:</p>


    <table>
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <td>Company</td>   <td>Title</td>      <td>Location</td>  <td>State</td> <td>Salary</td>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody id="search-results">

        </tbody>
    </table>
