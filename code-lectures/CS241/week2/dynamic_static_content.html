Objectives for Today

By the end of today, you will:

   * Identify the division of responsibility between servers and clients.
   * Define dynamic and static content as they relate to web development.
   * Understand how to use tags to describe semantic content in HyperText Markup Language (HTML).
   * Be able to target and manipulate specific HTML tags with Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) selectors.



Static and Dynamic Content

A server exposes a service or resource over a computer network, and a client is anything which consumes that service.

This week, we're going to talk a bit more about what this means practically when we are designing an application for the web.


A well-designed web-app is one that creates a "division of responsibility" between the server and client.
This means that different types of work should generally be done on the server or on the client, but not both.


                                               It is the ________'s responsibility to......

                                      Server                 |                    Client
                      -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                             |
                       permanently store any shared or       |   temporarily cache any 'local' data that the
                         public data the user may need       |   user is working with 'right now' (or that the
                                                             |    server doesn't need to know about)
                                                             |
                     Manage "interfaces" that describe       |  Make requests against interfaces asking to read
                      how a client is permitted to access    |  or change portions of the data that a user is
                      and modify server data                 |  interacting with right now.
                                                             |
                     Host code that models the data          |  Host code that describes workflows and views that
                     related to a server's purpose, as       |  make the data understandable to users, including any
                     well as the rules for accessing and     |  "presentation" / stylization / formatting.
                     validating that data.                   |
                                                             |
                                                             |
                    Serve the client code to the client.     |
                                                             |
                                                             |



In particular, let us focus on that last point -- in very simple web applications, this will be the vast majority of a server's
responsibility. For example, let's go take a look at the first ever website: http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html.


What data does this server need to store? What modifications can users make?

The answer is that they don't make modifications at all. This is a website that was written once as a file, and that same file
is served to everyone every time they visit this site. Nothing ever reads from a data store, nothing responds to who is viewing
the website or when.


We call this type of web content "static content", because a static, unchanging file sits on the server, and the only
thing the serverneeds to do is *serve* that file as-is. With static content, the only programming that we can do occurs
in client-side code.


The alternative to static content is "dynamic content".

Dynamic content is content where the server doesn't know what it will return to a user until the moment the user makes a request.
The server must do some processing to handle the request, often reading from a database or transforming the user's request in some
way to produce its response. In dynamic websites, there will usually be coding done on both the server and the client.


                                           This content is....
                              Dynamic    |                                            |    Static
                      -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                         |                                            |
                                         |        The first website ever              |        X
                                         |           (Pure HTML and CSS)              |
                                         |                                            |
                              X          |       A page of Google search results      |
                                         |                                            |
                                         |       An "About Me" page with a photo      |        X
                                         |         and some styled text               |
                                         |                                            |
                              X          |      An Amazon shopping cart               |
                                         |                                            |
                              X          |      A discussion board where you log      |
                                         |       in to post questions                 |
                                         |                                            |
                                         |      A website that hosts an archive       |        X
                                         |         of old Flash games                 |
                                         |                                            |


For the rest of today, we will focus on the most common type of static content: HTML pages.

-->
<html>

<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles/main_styles.css">
</head>


<body>

<a id="top_of_page"></a>

<section id="HTML">

<h2>HTML</h2>



<p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a "markup language" that we use to author and style content for the web.</p>

<p>"Markup" in this name refers to fact that HTML content is represented as exactly the text we want to show to our users,
but "marked up" and decorated with tags that organize and describe the content. Unlike a programming language, we cannot
use a markup language to solve problems or give the computer a series of instructions: everything we add to the page is
  content that we are declaring exists.</p>

<p>The key component that differentiates HTML from plain text is the use of tags. A tag is a word of text that is surrounded
by &lt;angle brackets &gt;. Most tags come in pairs, and apply their meaning to everything inside the pair.  A closing tag
will have an identical name to its opening tag, but it will be prefixed by a / .</p>

<p>The most basic example of a tag is the  &lt;html &gt; tag, which we put at the beginning and end of our document to declare
that everything inside is HTML. We can also use the &lt;body &gt; tag to surround all the text that we want our users to
actually see, and the  &lt;p &gt; tag to surround each individual paragraph of text.</p>


<p> Some tags, like the img tag, do not require a closing tag -- they represent something we want to insert into the page
  that has meaning on its own. </p>

<img src="grumpy-cat-small.png" width="400px">

<p> Notice that our image tag also has something else in addition to just its name.

  It's not enough to just tell a browser that an image exists. We have to tell it <em>what we have an image of</em>. Since details
  like this have their own semantic meaning, we use special name-value pairs called "attributes" inside of the tag to share these
  details. In this case, src is an abbreviation for the "source" location for this image (think like "sources" that you cite in
  a paper.)</p>

<p>Attributes will always be names and values joined by an equals sign:</p>

<img src="grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" width="400px">


<p>Hyperlinks are created using the &lt;a&gt; tag. A is short for "anchor", because these anchors tie two different
  places on the web  together. Typically, an anchor tag is used with the <strong>href</strong> attribute, which has a
  full path to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML">another website</a>.
  If you want to link to another file the same folder, then you can just use the file's name.</p>


<p> There is another way to use the anchor tag: When the anchor's <strong>href</strong> uses a name prefixed by a #,
  the browser will search for an id attribute on the same page and scroll to the anchor. </p>


<p><a href="#top_of_page">Return to top</a></p>
</section>


<section id="CSS">
  <h3> Styling </h3>

  <p>CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets". Cascading Style Sheets are an extension to HTML that allows us to declare
    special "rules" that modify our HTML tags. Like HTML itself, these rules are 'declarative' -- a CSS stylesheet is
    a list of information, and the browser is responsible for interpreting that information to produce a rendered web page. </p>


  <p class="even_paragraph"> Each rule starts with a selector that describes what tags (and content inside those tags) we want to target. Afterward,
    we have a pair of  {curly braces}, inside of which we place one or more declaration that describes how to change
    those targeted tags. </p>

  <p> Typically, CSS is written in its own separate file, ending with the .css extension. It is then linked to the HTML page
    using a "link" tag. Let's try out a few examples now.</p>

  <img src="grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" style="margin:auto; display:block" width="400px">

  <p>The simplest selectors are just tags! If we provide the name of the tag in the selector region of a CSS rule, then
    that block of declarations will apply to all matching tags in our document.</p>

   <p class="even_paragraph">In addition, there are two other common selectors: id selectors and class selectors.
     Every single tag in HTML has two attributes in common -- we can specify an id that uniquely identifies that
     specific element, and a class that labels that element as being part of a set of similarly styled groups (each
     group is separated by a space). Then, in our CSS rules, we can use #ID_NAME to refer to an element by id, and
     .CLASS_NAME to refer to an element by class.</p>


</section>


<section id="combinators">

  <h3>Combinators and Pseudo-selectors</h3>
  <p>In addition to targeting individual tags or groups of tags with selectors, CSS also gives us the power to mix multiple
    selectors together to talk about elements in relation to one another. The symbol we use to combine the two selectors
    determines the relationship we are expressing between the two selectors. For a tag1 followed by a tag2 that we want to combine, CSS
    gives us several useful selectors:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A space expresses "any tag2 that is inside of a tag1", at any depth.
      This is the <strong>descendent selector</strong>.</li>
    <li>A right-facing arrow (the greater than sign > ), expresses "any tag2
      that is <em>directly</em> inside a tag1". This is the <strong>child
        selector</strong>. </li>
    <li>A tilde (~) expresses "any tag2 that is adjacent to a tag1". This is
      the <strong>sibling selector</strong>.</li>
    <li>A plus (+) expresses "any tag2 that is directly adjacent to a tag1". This is
      the <strong>sibling selector</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Additionally, there are a few special "suffixes" we can add to our selectors to indicate
    that we want to target an element that is currently in a particular state.
    We call these suffixes <strong>pseudo-classes</strong> or <strong>pseduo-selectors</strong>.
  </p>


  <p>
    Pseudo-classes are written by taking any selector, adding a colon ( : ),
    then adding the name of the pseduo-class. A few useful pseduo-classes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>:hover allows us to refer to an element that's touching our mouse.</li>
    <li>:nth-child(N) allows us to refer to every Nth element of a type.</li>
    <li>:target allows us to refer to an element with an id that matches the
      last anchor tag we clicked on our page.</li>
    <li>:checked allows us to refer to a checkbox or radio button that is currently
      selected.</li>
  </ul>
