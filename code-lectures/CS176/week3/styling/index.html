<p>Before we get started talking about how to style our pages, let's learn a bit of background about how the
    computer thinks about a web page.</p>

<section id="dom">

    <h3>The Document Object Model</h3>

    We can represent the content of a web page in many different formats.

    <ul>
    <li>Last class, we learned how to represent web content as nested tags using HTML.</li>
    <li>The browser represents web content as a bunch of elements positioned across a page.</li>
    <li>Programming languages (like Javascript) need to represent web content as classes and objects.</li>
    </ul>


        <p class="second_paragraph">It turns out, we can notate all of these different representations in a single,
            platform-agnostic format, which we call the <strong>Document Object Model</strong>.

            The Document Object Model represents all of the nested sets of tags that we learned
            about last class as nodes into a tree (sort of like the trees you see in the left
            pane of a file browser when expanding a series of folders.)</p>

        <img
                src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/DOM-model.svg/1024px-DOM-model.svg.png"
                style="display: block; max-width:20%; margin: auto; margin-top: 20px"

        >


        <p>In the DOM, each 'level' on the tree represents a tag that surrounds all of
            its children nodes. When the browser receives HTML code, the first thing it does
            is convert that code into a DOM tree like the one pictured here.</p>

        <p>Text is really inconvenient to work with as a computer... every time you load the page,
        it needs to go out and find where tags start and end, what 'sections' of the content exist to
        layout. Programs are really good at working with tree-like data, and we've developed
            many techniques for searching and manipulating trees efficiently. As a consequence,
            converting an HTML document into a DOM tree allows the browser to easily navigate the
            page when applying styling and interacting with JavaScript code.</p>

</section>

<section id="block_v_inline">
    <h3>Block and Inline Elements</h3>


    <p>When the browser wants to convert a DOM tree into a rendered website, one
        of the first things it has to do is identify the major "blocks" of content and
        calculate where each should be positioned on the page.</p>

    <p class="second_paragraph">It does this by scanning all the nodes in the DOM, and figuring out
        which ones actually represent new blocks of content, and which only change
        something that exists inside a block.</p>

    <p>It turns out, we can pretty cleanly divide (almost) all HTML tags into two
        categories:</p>


    <p><strong>Block</strong> elements represent a new block of content. When the
        browser renders them, it assumes they're going to take up the entire width of the
        page, and gives them a blank line of space above and below unless otherwise
        specified.</p>

    <p><strong>Inline</strong> elements represent labels, styling, or elements
        that otherwise "fit" inside an existing block, but don't carve out their own space.</p>


    <p>So why do we care about all of this? Because it's going to inform how we can add our own
        additional styles  to our web pages using another language called CSS!</p>

</section>


<section id="rules">
    <h3>What is CSS?</h3>

    <p>CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets".

        Cascading Style Sheets are an extension to HTML that allows us to declare
        special "rules" that modify our HTML tags. Like HTML itself, these rules are
        'declarative' -- a CSS stylesheet is a list of information, and the browser is
        responsible for interpreting that information to produce a rendered web page.
    </p>


    <img src="https://media.prod.mdn.mozit.cloud/attachments/2014/11/18/9461/012655e623bef579c9bd376e227bc648/css-declaration-small.png"
         width=400
    >


    <p class="second_paragraph">
        The most common place to put these rules is in a separate file, which we can 'attach'
        to this document using a &lt;link> tag. It contains a <em>rel</em> attribute
        which indicates that this link is to a stylesheet, and it contains an href attribute
        similar to our anchor tags, that indicates where this stylesheet is located.
    </p>


    <p>CSS rules follow a special syntax, similar to our tags:

    <ul>
        <li>First, they specify a 'selector' or group of selectors, which represents
            what elements should be changed.</li>
        <li>Next, they open a 'block' of declarations using a pair of {curly braces}.</li>
        <li>Inside this block, they define one or more property:value pairs separated by a colon,
            with a semicolon at the end.</li>
    </ul>


    <p>
        What is it that makes Cascading Style Sheets "cascading"? -- We can apply multiple
        rules that each overlap. However, when these rules conflict, one has to win.

        When this happens, the <em>most specific rule</em> wins:

    <ul id="priority-list">
        <li>Style added 'inline' with a style attribute is more specific than ID.</li>
         <li>IDs are more specific than classes.</li>
         <li>Classes are more specific than elements.</li>
         <li>Tags that are 'inside' other tags are more specific than their containers.</li>
         <li>When two rules 'tie', the last rule applied wins. </li>
    </ul>

</section>


<section id="selectors" class="course_content third_paragraph in_a_box">

    <h3>Selectors</h3>
    <p>A selector is the first part of our CSS style rules. A selector lets us specify the
        element or elements that we want to modify with our properties. Selectors are powerful,
        and contain many flourishes that let us precisely point to specific elements or groups
        of elements. We will be discussing a few of these next class.</p>



    <p class="second_paragraph"> However, the simplest selectors are just
        tags! If we provide the name of the tag in the selector region of a CSS rule, then
        that block of declarations will apply to all matching tags in our document.
        Let's try this out in our common_styles.css by setting default styling for our
        sections, images, and body.</p>


    <p>
        In addition, there are two other common selectors: id selectors and class selectors.
        Every single tag in HTML has two attributes in common -- we can specify an
        <strong>id</strong> that uniquely identifies that specific element, and a
        <strong>class</strong> that labels that element as being part of a set of similarly
        styled groups (each group is separated by a space). Then, in our CSS rules, we can
        use #ID_NAME to refer to an element by id, and .CLASS_NAME to refer to an element
        by class.
    </p>
</section>



<section id="properties">
    <h3>Common Properties</h3>

    <h4>Colors</h4>
    There are several declarations that deal with colors.

    <ul>
        <li><strong>color</strong> sets the color of text.</li>
        <li><strong>background-color</strong> sets the color for the whitespace behind the element.</li>
        <li><strong>border-color</strong> sets an optional outline for a block.</li>
    </ul>

    All of these color-based properties use 'web colors'. Web colors can be specified
    in a few ways: either by using a six digit hexadecimal number, a three digit
    hexidecimal number, a special color name, or the rgb() or hsl() css "functions".

    When we use a three or six digit number, each third of the number refers to a
    different color: the first third holds information about red values, the next
    third holds information about green values, and the final third holds information
    about the blue values:
    <img src="https://files.cdn.printful.com/o/upload/bfl-image/26/11372_l_R.png" style="width: 400px">


    <h4>Length</h4>

    Length is used for properties such as width, height, margin, and padding.
    Length can be specified as:

    <ul>
        <li>pixels (px)</li>
        <li>% of screen (%)</li>
        <li>"size of the letter m"-s (em)</li>
        <li>and so <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/units.en.html">
            many more</a>...</li>
    </ul>


    <p>An element's width and height aren't always its width and height. The content
        area of an element (where text and child elements will actually display) does
        not include its margin (the extra space left beyond the edge of the element),
        border (a styled line around the edge of the element), or padding (space inside
        the element's "box",) by default. These different measures of space around an
        element are collectively referred to as the <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-box-model-44fc2c04a935">
            "box model"</a>.</p>


    <img src="https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/1*2jZwpWH9XO_QllhEpyGqMA.png"
         width="600px">


    However, if we use the "box-sizing: border-box" attribute for an element, then
    padding and border are included in the width. Where possible, you should
    try to position elements using only these tools we've learned about today:
    (width, height, margin, and padding.) Doing this will help your page reflow
    properly on screens of different sizes. Next class we'll learn a few tricks
    for when that's insufficient.


    <h4>Content Outside the Flow: Floating</h4>

    <p>Sometimes, we have content that we want to appear "off to the side". In these situations, we can use one other
        positional attribute: float. When we 'float' content, it will appear off to the side of its containing block:</p>


    <div style="width: 400px; height: 200px; margin: auto; padding: 30px; background-color: darkblue">
        <div style="width:50px;
                    height: 70px;
                    background-color: mediumvioletred;
                    float: left;
                    margin-right: 10px;
                    ">

            This box floats!
        </div>
        I have a bunch of text that appears inside this special blue box. However, watch what happens when we add
        a floating element above it in the document.

    </div>


    <p>Note: floating should be used as a last resort, when other styles of positioning are unable to get you what
        you want. Floating will make it hard to further position elements in the area around the float.</p>
