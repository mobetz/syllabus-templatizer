  <h3>Objectives for Today</h3>
  <p>By the end of today, you will be able to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify how to link JavaScript code to our webpages.</li>
    <li>Describe four types of statements available to us in JavaScript.</li>
    <li>Practice writing a few simple Javascript statements to store, update, and display data in the web dev console.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

  <h3>Javascript</h3>
  <p>JavaScript is a fully-featured programming language. A programming language differs from the markup languages we've
    used so far in a few important ways. Our markup languages have been 'declarative' -- we write all of the things we
    want, and the browser figures out how to order and prioritize different rules. By contrast, a programming
    language is more like giving instructions to a very pedantic person: every instruction will be executed exactly as
    written, in order.</p>


  <p>
    Today, we will talk about four simple categories of statements we can use in Javascript:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Assignment -- the ability to 'save' a piece of data into a 'variable' with the equals sign.</li>
    <li>Functions -- the ability to 'declare' and later 'call' a whole group of instructions we want to run.</li>
    <li>Conditional Branches -- the ability to only follow instructions 'if' a condition is met.</li>
    <li>Loops -- the ability to repeatedly follow instructions 'while' a condition is met.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>But first, we need to connect our Javascript code page to our HTML page. This is going to work quite similarly
    to how we connect CSS to our webpages -- with a tag in the head.</p>
