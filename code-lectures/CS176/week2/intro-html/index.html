    <h3>
        HTML: Tags and Attributes
    </h3>

    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.</p>

    <p>A markup language is a system for annotating content with additional information
        that may convey formatting, presentation or the structure of data. Hypertext refers
        to the links that connect pages on the web.
    </p>

    <p>One of the common prototypical markup languages that's used by many applications
        is XML. HTML is actually a derivative of XML (the eXtensible Markup Language.)</p>

    <p>In HTML, markup is indicated using "tags". A <strong>tag</strong> is just a word of text surrounded
        by &lt;angle brackets&gt;. The most basic tag is the &lt;html &gt; tag, which
        identifies a document as being html.</p>

    <p>Most tags in HTML identify regions on a page: they come in pairs, and indicate where
        a certain feature of the document begins, and also where it ends. A closing tag
        will have an identical name to its opening tag, but it will be prefixed by a /.  These
        tags will always end in last-opened first-closed order, almost like nesting dolls.</p>

    <img src="img/grumpy-cat-small.png" alt="An image describing our tag.">

    <p>Inside the html tag, there are two main sections of the html document: a HEAD,
        and a BODY.<</p>

    <p>The BODY represents everything about the page we interact with inside the tab.</p>

    <p>The HEAD holds extra metadata about the page that does not get displayed directly,
        but may be useful for the browser, assistive technologies, or a search engine.</p>

    <p>Notice how our rendered website isn't respecting our whitespace? We have to
        identify where paragraphs start and end using &lt;p&gt; tags. Similarly, we can use
        &lt;h1&gt; through &lt;h6&gt; to represent different levels of headers and subheaders.
    </p>

    <p> We can emphasize important terms with &lt;em&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;. </p>

    <p> Images are specified using the &lt;img&gt; tag. However, images also work just
        a little bit differently. Some tags like images require more information than we
        could give them using just our "nesting doll" positioning. For these types of tags,
        we can use "attributes": Attributes are key-value pairs that identify additional
        features about the content inside the tag.

        To add an attribute, we use the name, an equals sign, then the value "inside quotation
        marks".
    </p>

    <p>The img tag requires a <strong>src</strong> (source) attribute, which points to
        the link where the image is located, and accepts other attributes for sizing information
        like height and width: </p>

    <img src="img/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" >



    <p> One last major structural tag is the <em>hyperlink</em>.


        Hyperlinks are created using the &lt;a&gt; tag. A is short for "anchor",
        because these anchors tie two different places on the web together. Typically,
        an anchor tag is used with the <strong>href</strong> attribute, which has
        a full path to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML">
            another website.</a> If you want to link to another file the same folder,
        then you can just use the <a href="contact_info.html">file's name</a>.


    <p> There is another way to use the anchor tag: When used with the
        <strong>name</strong> or <strong>id</strong> attribute, an anchor can also save a position on a
        page. Then, if another anchor's <strong>href</strong> uses that name with
        a #, we can instantly navigate back to the anchor.
    </p>

<p><a href="#top_of_page">Return to top</a></p>
<p><a href="./contact_info.html">Go to the Contact Me page</a></p>



    <p> One final note on writing HTML: if you want to type something out that HTML would incorrectly
        render as a tag, we can do so using <em>escape codes</em>.Escape codes are specified
        with an ampersand (&amp;) and ending with a semicolon (;). For instance, we can use
        &amp; to refer to ampersand, and and &amp;lt; (less than) to refer to our opening
        bracket in our tag.</p>


    <section id="semantics">

    <h3>Semantic Tags</h3>

    <p>Most tags in HTML don't actually <em>do</em> anything at all, beyond setting some
        basic positional data, and maybe having a bit of default styling.</p>

    <p>We even have two proto-tags that represent this behavior with no extra meaning
        attached:</p>

    <p><strong>&lt;div&gt;</strong> represents a block in the document with no additional meaning.</p>


    <p><strong>&lt;span&gt;</strong> represents an inline segment of text with no additional meaning.</p>

    <p>If we wanted to, we could go through and replace every one of our paragraph,
        header, strong, and emphasis tags with a bunch of divs and spans. So why do
        we bother learning about so many more?</p>


    <p> If we only had divs and spans, our webpage would end up looking something
        like this:</p>


    <xmp>
        <div></div>
        <div>
            <span>Welcome to my page</span>
            <div>
                <div>
                    <img src="...">
                    <div>Look at this cool image</div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>Copyright 2020</div>
    </xmp>


    <p> Looking at a page like this, it's nearly impossible to figure out what any
        of those divs represent. What's worse, if we were trying to parse the HTML
        not as a human, but instead as a machine, we'd have no way of knowing what
        any of these divs meant and which were important. </p>

    <p>A lot of elements, such as &lt;section&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, and even &lt;p&gt; serve mainly
        as clues for ourselves, other developers, and machines to help give <em>meaning</em>
        to the structure of our document. Imagine instead our document above looked like
        this: </p>


    <xmp>
        <header></header>
        <section>
            <h3>Welcome to my page</h3>
            <article>
                <figure>
                    <img src="...">
                    <figcaption>Look at this cool image</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </article>
        </section>
        <footer>Copyright 2020</footer>
    </xmp>

    <p>Now, it becomes clear which parts of the page are organizational, and which have
        the main content we actually care about.The practice of using meaningful tags
        that describe not just the layout, but also the purpose of different parts of the
        page is known as <strong>Semantic HTML</strong>, and the introduction of semantics
        into our HTML documents has been one of the biggest pushes in modern HTML standards. </p>
