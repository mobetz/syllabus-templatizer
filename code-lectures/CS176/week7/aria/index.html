    <h3>Accessibility as a Standard</h3>


    <p>
        Originally, web pages weren't much more than some text on a page with minor changes to color and position. However, as
        our websites became more enriched with different types of tags with their own style rules, they started to become
        less and less accessible.

        As we introduced style rules to completely change where an element appears or how it is displayed,
        and we began layering more tags to achieve complex designs, assistive technologies
        had more work to do to help users navigate the web.
    </p>


    <p>
        When we say accessibility, we are referring to how well our site can be interacted with by users with disabilities.


        Much like our discussion of responsive web design last week, accessibility covers a wide range of different user
        experiences.

        Users may have vision problems, such as reduced visual clarity or color perception.
        They may even be completely blind, and use text-to-speech screen readers to navigate the web.
        They may also have motor problems and use input methods other than a typical keyboard and mouse.
    </p>


    <p>
        If we want to observe these tools in action, we can use a tool such as a screen reader,
        available as browser plugins like <a
            href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screen-reader/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn?hl=en"
            aria-label="link to ChromeVox screen reader">
        here</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        As assistive technologies evolved to meet the new enriched web, we came across
        patterns of websites that could effectively be translated to other modalities,
        and others which were hard to navigate. To help codify these patterns for web
        developers, we created the Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) standard.

<section tabindex="1" id="rules">
    <h3>The Five Rules of ARIA</h3>


    <p>
        The core of the ARIA standard is five rules that guide the development of websites.
        Those rules are:
    </p>


    <ol>
        <li><h4>When possible, express content using meaningful semantic HTML Tags</h4>
            <p>Screen readers specialize in figuring out how to display web content. If
                you use meaningful tags for your content, screen readers can often figure
                out how to appropriately present that content without any further intervention
                on your part!</p>
        </li>



        <li><h4>At the very least, do not use tags in a way that <em>contradicts</em> the
            normal semantic meaning.</h4>

            <p>For the same reason that using tags semantically causes them to display
                appropriately on a screen reader, using tags in a way that conflicts with
                their normal meaning will cause assistive technology to incorrectly assume
                the role of an element. For example, turning a "header" tag into a clickable
                tab might cause confusion to users who are primarily hearing about tags by
                role. In particular, try not to cross the "interactive"/"non-interactive"
                barrier.
            </p>


        <li><h4>Your website must be navigable without the use of a mouse.</h4>
        <p>Mice are notoriously precise, and difficult to emulate if a user
            cannot actually manually point one. Instead, most users with assistive
            technology make use of tab-controls or another tool that uses a tab
            control (such as saying the word "next".) You should be able to navigate
            between controls and between text in a sane order.
        </p>


        <li><h4>Do not hide elements that can trap focus.</h4>
        <p> Since we are saying all controls should be easy to navigate between,
            it stands to reason that we should not "hide" controls that can still
            steal focus (since using tab may cause the site to behave differently
            than the way it does to normal users.) One exception to this: if you
            use display: none or visibility: hidden, an element can no longer be
            the target of focus, and its safe to hide it from the aria view.
        </p>
    </li>

        <li><h4>Controls on a site should have accessible and meaningful labels.</h4>
            <p>Without visual cues, there is no direct link between labeling elements
                and the things they label:

                <img src="labels.png" alt="An image of labeled inputs">

                We must ensure that, if labels are contained in an element separate
                from the control themselves, that these labels are appropriately linked
                through the use of aria attributes.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
</section>




<section tabindex="2" id="basic-considerations">
    <h3>Basic Considerations</h3>

    <h4>"Click Me!" Links and Buttons</h4>
    <p>
        When we have a link, ideally we should put descriptive text in the link itself.
        When we can't do that, we can use the aria-label="" attribute to set additional
        text that can be associated with a link or button. We can add labels to our
        link and navigation drawer.
    </p>
</section>


<section tabindex="3" id="aria-tags">

    <h3>Hidden and Role Manipulation</h3>


    <p>
        When we show or hide controls, we should make those controls are actually added
        or removed from the document. For instance, we may want to ensure our navigation
        menu can only be tabbed to while it is on screen.

        Similarly, we can manipulate roles of tags to change how a screen reader reads them
        to be more in-line with a way a user would think about them. Watch what happens if
        we change the role of our checkbox to be a 'button'.

        There is one special role in ARIA: presentation. Watch what happens when we try
        setting the presentation role on an element.

        When we set a presentation role, those elements will be treated as plain text. We should
        be careful not to set important interactive elements to the presentation role.
    </p>

    <h4 >Aria-Label and Aria-LabelledBy</h4>


    <p aria-flowto="tab-control">
        We can specify labels using the aria-label as we saw before to set a label on
        our link and navigation button. Similarly, we can use aria-labelledby to indicate
        which ID in the document holds the label text:
    </p>


    <label id="name-label">User Name:</label><input type="text" aria-labelledby="name-label">
    <label for="mytextbox">User Name:</label><input id="mytextbox" type="text">
</section>



<section tabindex="4" id="tab-control">

    <h3>Controlling Tab Order</h3>
    We can set a tabindex="" on each focusable element to specify the order we want to tab through them,
    starting with one. A tabindex will even allow things we can normally not tab to steal focus on the
    page.


    <h4>Controlling Text Read Order</h4>
    In addition to tab order, we can also set normal text order using the aria-flowto property. This
    property specifies the next thing we want to flow to when using normal text navigation in a
    screen reader.
