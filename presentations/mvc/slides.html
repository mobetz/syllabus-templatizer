    <h2 class="slide-title">What is MVC?</h2>

      <p >The Model-View-Controller pattern describes a way to break up GUI applications to better encapsulate graphical code.</p>
      <p >In MVC, classes belong to one of three categories:

        <ul>
          <li><span class="term">Model</span> - These classes hold business logic unrelated to GUIs.</li>
          <li><span class="term">View</span> - These classes represent actual GUI controls that display to the user.</li>
          <li><span class="term">Controller</span> - These classes implement the logic that connects the model and view.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

  <section>
    <h2 class="slide-title">What is MVC?</h2>

    <p>In MVC, the Controller acts as an <span class="term">intermediary</span> between the view and the model.</p>
    <p>During initialization, the controller subscribes to events on both sides, and forwards updates
      to the other representation.
    </p>
    <p>However, once this setup occurs, the view and model are often <span class="term">directly linked</span>.</p>
  </section>


  <section>
    <h2 class="slide-title">Why MVC?</h2>

    <p>The major benefit of MVC is the <span class="term">separation</span> of business logic code and rendering code.</p>
    <p>Model classes don't need anything like "toTextbox()" or "asGridRow()" methods -- those transformations are part of the controller.
    </p>
    <p>View classes don't have to know how to handle any type of data ever written (that data will be transformed by the controller.)</p>
    <p>Note: this means <span class="term">the controller is doing a lot</span>!</p>
  </section>


  <section>
    <h2 class="slide-title">MVC in JavaFX</h2>

    <p>MVC is the main paradigm implemented by many UI libraries like JavaFX.</p>
    <p>The view is implemented with UI Control classes like Button, Textbox, Label, and TableView, usually 
      via a <span class="term">declarative layout</span> file.</p>
    <p>The model classes are provided by the user as <span class="term">Plain Old Java Objects</span>.</p>
    <p>The Controller is specified in the view's FXML, and overrides/subscribes to events on the view and the model.</p>
