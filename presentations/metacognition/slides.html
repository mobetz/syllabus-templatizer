      and grow, <span class="term">building an electrical path</span> between those parts of your brain!</p>

    <h2 class="slide-title">The Role of Sleep and Healthy Diet in Learning</h2>


    <p>
      As you concentrate, your 'spark' causes damage. Your body needs time to <span class="term">repair</span> neurons and
      build back stronger (just like how working out causes tears and makes you feel sore, but gives you stronger
      muscles after rest.)
    </p>

    <p  class="fragment">
      During sleep, your brain has its best chance to repair and refresh your neurons.
      If you are tired, it likely means your body <span class="term">hasn't had a chance</span> to make repairs!
    </p>


    <p  class="fragment">
      Sleep also gives your 'spark' a chance to explore. This is one theory behind why we <span class="term">dream</span>
      -- Dreaming is your mind traveling pathways it might not while you are awake, forming connections and helping
      you learn.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2 class="slide-title">The Role of Sleep and Healthy Diet in Learning</h2>


    <p>
      Your brain needs protein, fat, energy, and nutrients as building blocks to <span class="term">create</span> neurons,
      and to make repairs.
    </p>

    <p  class="fragment">
      If you try to learn while hungry, you will be in 'energy-saving' mode; your body will create the fewest connections it thinks
      it needs.
    </p>


    <p  class="fragment">
      If you never use something you learned, your body will try to <span class="term">conserve energy</span>
      by letting that connection go unmaintained, making it harder to use. We <span class="term">practice</span>
      with labs and homework so your brain knows that connection is important!

    <div class="spaced">

      <p>Computer programming works the same way! We should always
        <span class="term">plan</span> before we code, then <span class="term">reflect</span> on what parts of the
        program work or don't work.</p>

      <p class="fragment">Note: This is why I always start lectures with <span class="term">learning outcomes</span>
        that represent our "goals" -- so you can reflect on how each new idea I introduce relates to these goals.</p>
